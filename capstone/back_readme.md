## Local Requirements

Requires Python 3.7 or later

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend micro-services framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## Database Setup

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first en sure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.

# Full Stack Trivia API Frontend

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: the frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

> _tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Required Tasks

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use `npm start`. You can change the script in the `package.json` file.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```bash
npm start
```
